This is the perfect script for people who want to make their private collection of images, gifs, webms, or videos make public or make easier to search. All you have to do is put the `index.php` file in the folder of your choosing, make it available to your web server and done. When you navigate to it you will have a working **BETA** listing of files.

The look and feel is taken from 4Chan.

Take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/andreicek/listme), or the [project page](http://andreicek.eu/listme). Example comming soon.
