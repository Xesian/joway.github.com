Posted on [my old site](http://andreicek.hostghost.io/why-is-a-referendum-about-gay-rights-a-bad-idea/) - 28 Oct 2013. Original title: Why is a referendum about gay rights a bad idea? And, why is any kind of referendum about human rights truly a disaster waiting to happen?

Today (28. 10. 2013.) Croatian federal constitutional court ruled that if a referendum is held the saying of Croatian people is going to be final. Now, you might say, this is true democracy in its purest form. **False**.

By the definition a referendum is:

> ... a direct vote in which an entire electorate is asked to either accept or reject a particular proposal. (...) It is a form of direct democracy.
>		-- Wikipedia

What that actually means is that a **majority rules the minority**. In other words we might find that if we gave the people the rights to change basic human rights we would have a closed minded society with a lot more problems than a gay marriage could ever do. (And really, why anyone would think gay marriage is a problem is beyond me.)

We might find that children with any kinds of disability would be discriminated from schools, that people of other races would be "removed", etc. The list really just goes on and on. What this reminds me of, and I will be quite frank here, is pure nazism. Now it might seem that this isn't a threat because people will go out and vote to give rights where they are due, but allowing this referendum is showing that basic human rights are **subject to change** and that is not acceptable.

I urge you **to vote** so we, the Croatian people, show that we are also a modern society. I also urge you to let everybody know that in future this kinds of questions **are not in fact public** and are not to be decided by public too.

To Croatian government I would just want to say, as a political party colleague, to never give this referendum a green light to **prevent a disaster in the long run**.
