I'm my short time I call my self a student I came across different people that share almost the same trait when it comes to development or studying. They, including me!, will often say that we are "too dense", "not smart enough", or "just don't get it" to the tasks that we predefined as dull, not offering a personal gain, or just plain not being needed. It is common knowledge that this slows you down quite a bit, and I am not here to talk about why this happens - but how to combat this.

##Can't do attitude

We all start from this point. It doesn't matter if you study software development, art, or history - there is that one class that you said, after the first lecture - *I can't do this*. Now, what people do to combat this is asking one simple question - *Why?*. If that works for you, done. But I find that in 9/10 times this won't do the trick. So what is to do then?

The solution is not simple, and is not universal - but not only from per person point of view - from per time of day point of view too. You CAN NOT expect from yourself to work the same at any given time. So with no further ado -

##The "solution"

There are four simple steps for doing this, and I will go thru every single one of them.

###1. Start

In order to find where the problem is exactly you need to start working on it. It doesn't matter if it's just writing a few sentences, or initializing variables. What is important is to get your hands dirty. That brings me to the second step.

###2. Try

Now, you may not know the solution to the given problem just yet - but you may as well try to fake it. Don't be afraid to make it as bad as you can. This is to make your brain think - "Ok, we've got this."

###3. Scrap everything, despair for a second

> Wow, my work is bad. Ctrl-A, Del. Where am I going with this. I should look for another job, gardening sounds like fun.

After this important step your brain will start thinking. Ok - so we have this thing A, and we need to get to this thing B. Think of key words, then google. Look at manuals, books, older work and the solution will start appearing in front of you. This isn't as hard as you think it is.

###4. You may be here, or you may not

And it's Ok. It is fine to not know the solution to everything, but what is important in life is to at least try to get to the solution. With your half baked result you can now ask for help in a more constructive way. Your friends, colleges, forums, chats, etc.

Finally you'll be done. And another tasks awaits you. Rinse and repeat.
