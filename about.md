Hello, I am a software engineering student from Croatia.

My main interests at the moment are algorithms, web applications, Java and Linux administration. I also work in ruby and python (sysadmin scritping), C++ and C# (school work).

My hobbies are system and network administration, electronics and running.

I had my CV on my site for a long time, but it was proven that it's not as versitile as my [LinkedIn](http://hr.linkedin.com/in/andreicek/) profile.

I love traveling, sea, LoFi rock music and cooking. 

Take a look at my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/andreicek). Follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andreicek).
